<h2>Meet</h2>
<h1>Donna J. Trump</h1>

<p>
  Imagine the Republican party picked <em>Donna</em> Trump to be their nominee
  instead of Donald. Donna is 70 year old woman and former reality TV star,
  who bases her claim that she is qualified to be president on the fact that
  she added to the enormous fortune she inherited from her father. Donna
  is bombastic and brash, and is known for unpolished, shoot-from-the-hip style.
</p>
<p>
  Take a minute to read about Donna's background, and ask yourself if you'd
  feel the same way about <em>her</em> as you do about <em>him</em>. <strong>
  And if you <em>don't</em>, please ask yourself <em>why</em>.</strong>

    intends to rely on her intuition to run the country.
