<h2>Meet</h2>
<h1>Donna J. Trump</h1>

<p>
   Imagine the Republicans picked <em>Donna</em> Trump to be their nominee
   instead of Donald. Donna is a former reality TV star, whose primary claim
   that she is qualified to be President is her (partially inherited) wealth.
   Donna is bombastic and brash, and is known for unpolished, shoot-from-the-hip
   style.
</p>
<p>
   Take a minute to read about Donna's resume, and ask yourself if you'd
   feel the same way about <em>her</em> as you do about <em>him</em>. <strong>
   And if you <em>don't</em>, please ask yourself <em>why</em>.</strong>
</p>

    intends to rely on her intuition to run the country.
